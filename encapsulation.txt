In Java, access modifiers (private, protected, and public) are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, fields, methods, and constructors within a program. They determine which parts of a class are accessible from other classes and packages. Here's a description of each access modifier:

Private (private):

Accessible only within the same class.
Members (fields, methods, constructors) marked as private cannot be accessed or modified by code outside the class.
Encourages encapsulation by hiding the internal implementation details of a class from external interference.
Typically used for fields and methods that are intended to be used only within the class itself.
Protected (protected):

Accessible within the same package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Members marked as protected can be accessed by subclasses (inheritance) and by other classes within the same package.
Provides a level of access between private and public, allowing for controlled access to certain class members.
Often used when you want subclasses to have access to certain fields or methods, but not necessarily other classes.
Public (public):

Accessible from any other class or package.
Members marked as public can be accessed and modified by any other class in the same or different packages.
Provides the widest level of access, allowing for unrestricted use of the class members.
Typically used for methods and fields that need to be accessible from outside the class, serving as the interface to the class.
